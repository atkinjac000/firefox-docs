# Extensions

## What are firefox extensions?

Extensions are small software programs that can enhance your browsing experience. Extensions usually do at least one of the following.

- Extend or enhance some sort of functionality
- Make tasks easier
- Allow for more personalized customization
- Improve Privacy and Security
- Use for games and entertainment 

This page focuses on how to add, access, use, and remove firefox extensions. By the end of this section of documentation you will be able to effectively use an extension.

## Accessing extensions

There are two main ways to navigate to the extensions page.

- Click the hamburger icon to the right of the searchbar (near the top right of the browser). Then click settings. From the settings page click "Extensions and Themes" near the bottom left corner of the page.

Most the time the extension you want won't be found under recommended extensions. To search for an extension go to [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/).

You can also navigate to the site by clicking the  "Find more add-ons" button from the extensions page.

From the addons site you can search for an extension by clicking on a category or by searching for one with the searchbar.

Once you find the extension you want click the "Add to firefox" button and click "add" on the permissions popup like we did earlier on in this section.


## Using an extension
Since each extension provides a different feature using each extension may be slightly different. You should easily find resources about each extension online. Don't panic, extensions are generally simple and easy to use.

I've already downloaded the "Grammar Checker & Paraphraser â€“ LanguageTool" extension. Using it is super simple.

Just navigate to somewhere on your web browser you type text. In this example we will use the extension to help write an email using Gmail.

Go to gmail and start writing a new message. When grammar suggestions are found they will be accessable by clicking a dot that appears near the bottom right. This shows a pop up modal you can use to easily apply desired suggestions.

Find the extension you want to manage. Click the toggle if you desire to enable/disable the extension.
