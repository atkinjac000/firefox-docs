# Introduction


## Why we chose Firefox for our software documentation project?

We chose Firefox for our software documentation project due to its security features, customizability, and developer tools. As programmers, we value its security measures and the ability to customize the browser to our needs. Firefox provides essential developer tools like a page source inspector, JavaScript console, JavaScript debugger, network tracker and numerous customization tools, aiding us in our daily tasks. Being open-source allows for updates and community contributions, making it a practical choice for our project.

At first glance, Firefox is pretty easy to use. It works like most other browsers, so most users will find it familiar. Instead of covering basic tasks like bookmarks, website visits, and browsing history, we decided to dig into some of the less common features. We explored developer tools, customization settings, and privacy and security options, which can be useful for some users. While Firefox is user-friendly, our focus was on revealing some of its advanced features used by developers and some power oriented users.	

To begin with, we were all somewhat familiar with the Firefox developer tools. However, to create a comprehensive tutorial, we had to tinker with various small features and figure out how each feature worked together. For instance, in the theming section, we had never used 'about:config' or 'about:profile' for more advanced Firefox features. We had to learn how to use these tools in order to implement the feature we were documenting. Similarly, there were many features we hadn't explored before, but for this assignment, we had to go through each button, toggle, and setting meticulously. This process helped us gain a somewhat better understanding of Firefox and its features in order to correctly document it.

## Audience

Our documentation is targeted at power users and developers. Some of the documentation is more focused on the power user audience, for example privacy and security. 

## Content
Each of us had to do some research when putting together the documentation. None of us were experts at using firefox so we had to become familiar with the tooling and features it provides before we could write documentation about it. We included many images and some videos along with text to better help the reader visualize important content. Visualizing the documentation helps the reader learn how to navigate firefox and use the tooling better.  We couldnâ€™t fit all of the tooling into the documentation so we each picked a couple tools that we thought would be most useful for our audience. Our audience was firefox power users and developers, with this in mind we added content beyond the simple "search for a website and browse the web".

## Appearance
We chose to use a Markdown to HTML compiler called mkdocs to format our document. This allowed us to define our formatting rules and then have them automatically applied to our entire document. We chose to do this because it guarantees a consistent style throughout our document. In addition to the consistent formatting, mkdocs produces HTML and CSS and due to the prevalence of these web technologies our document style and formatting could be preserved between different mediums. Mkdocs allows for choosing a theme that will define the layout, colors, and look of the document. We chose the Readthedocs theme because it had a sidebar with a table of contents and navigation along with a breadcrumb bar across the top. This decision was influenced by the in-class discussion about the Vim example from a previous year that also used mkdocs. The Vim example was critiqued because it had no breadcrumbs, and was difficult to navigate in a manual-like way. We found the Readthedocs theme to most closely match the navigation style of a handheld, physical book. The images that we used in our document are the only elements not tightly controlled by the mkdocs compiler, so we defined a style guide for those images. We decided that all images would be a screenshot of Firefox that provides sufficient context and has relevant portions pointed out with a 2px red box. This style has the effect of bringing the most important information to the forefront and bringing attention to the actions that need to be taken. 

## Our Experience
We completely underestimated how long it would take to divide responsibilities in this project. It was not easy to find a way of dividing capabilities amongst ourselves as most of the capabilities we documented had substantial overlap. It also surprised us how much more time it took to research each capability. We all thought we were relatively familiar with Firefox, but after diving in there were significantly more features we did not anticipate. 

Despite those minor setbacks, we all came to the decision to use mkdocs early on. This saved us a significant amount of time as mkdocs did all the organization and formatting for us. This made it so that we could all strictly focus on the content of our documentation. Splitting each capability into subtasks was extremely simple with mkdocs; all we had to do was add a header above each subtask. Mkdocs would then format the document in a way that was easily skimmable. It would also use the header as a section in the navigation tab to the left. This makes it extremely easy for a user to find the task they need to learn from our documentation.
